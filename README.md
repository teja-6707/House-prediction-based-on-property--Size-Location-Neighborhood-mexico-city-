Predicting Housing Prices in Buenos Aires & Mexico City
Project Overview

This project explores the prediction of housing prices using real-world datasets from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Mexico City, Mexico. The goal is to understand how different property features—such as size, location, and neighborhood—impact price, and to develop predictive models that can accurately estimate apartment prices.

The project is divided into four lessons and a final assignment:

Lesson 1: Predicting Price with Property Size

Lesson 2: Predicting Price with Property Location

Lesson 3: Predicting Price with Property Neighborhood

Lesson 4: Building a Comprehensive Price Prediction Model

Assignment: Combining insights from all lessons to predict apartment prices in Mexico City.

Key Insights

Property Size Matters: There is a strong positive correlation between the size of an apartment and its price.

Location is Critical: Broad location (city zones) and specific neighborhoods significantly influence property values.

Feature Engineering Improves Accuracy: Creating new features such as borough, lat/lon, and removing outliers improves model performance.

Data Skewness: Apartment price distributions are right-skewed, requiring careful consideration when modeling.

Baseline Model: The baseline mean absolute error (MAE) provides a reference point for model performance.

Feature Importance: Certain features, like apartment area and neighborhood, dominate in predicting price.
